### initial setup

#### system requirements for developing

The following software is needed for developing:  
The versions are what I used for development and testing. I will update the list if something changes.

#### project setup

1. execute a `git pull`
2. open project in VSCode
3. If you work with VSCode via remote software:  
   `{Ctrl}+{Shift}+{P}` -> `>Preferences: Open Settings (UI)` -> search for `keyboard.dispatch` and set it to `keyCode`  
   Restart or reload VSCode.
4. execute the following commands in order to set up the project:

```shell
# install dependencies
pnpm install
```

### scripts / commands

```shell
# dev run
pnpm run dev
# you get:
# - public slide show   > http://localhost:3030/
# - presenter mode      > http://localhost:3030/presenter/

# dev run
pnpm run devRemote
# like the normal `dev` command, but ports are open to full local network.

# build
pnpm run build

# export
pnpm run export
```

## FMADB

FMADB (Film Music Analysis Database) is a software that enables a detailed recording of music-theoretical parameters
over the temporal course of a film and thus supports film researchers in the analysis and evaluation of film music.
The software thus supports current research questions in the field of film music as a web service on the Internet by
structuring, processing and evaluating manually entered analytical data.

Head of project [https://fmadb.org](FMADB):

- [Thorsten Seyschab](https://todde.tv/) is responsible for the development of FMADB which includes the creation of
  the data models, the programming of all parts, the deployment and the maintenance.
- [Susanne Hardt](https://susannehardt.de/en) is responsible for the music theoretical background of FMADB and helped
  developing the meta data model for the music analytical parameters and their evaluations in the software.
